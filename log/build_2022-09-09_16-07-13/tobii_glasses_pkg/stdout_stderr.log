CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findnumpy.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "numpy", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "numpy" with any of
  the following names:

    numpyConfig.cmake
    numpy-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "numpy" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "numpy_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "numpy"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
