CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:29 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcv2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "cv2", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cv2" with any of
  the following names:

    cv2Config.cmake
    cv2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cv2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "cv2_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "cv2" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
